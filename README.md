# Dr 2.0 â€” an Amiga directory-lister commmand

This is a highly performant and very flexible command-line program for Amiga which lists files in a directory.
Its most unique feature is that it filters icon files (*.info) out of the output, and instead
marks whether a file has an icon by writing its name in an alternate color.
Besides listing files, it can also execute a command per file found, or format arbitrary output from each filename.
It can filter files by date, protection bits, patterns, and so on, and can apply a wildcard match recursively.

The full manual is in the file Dr.doc.html, which can be browsed at this link: http://paulkienitz.net/amiga/Dr.doc.html

No license, use it as you wish.
